## Milestone Project 4
This project is my submission for Milestone Project 4: Full Stack Frameworks with Django. The final project for the Level 5 Diploma in Web Applications Development.

### [Assessment Criteria](docs/assessment_criteria.pdf)

### Project Brief

1. Django Full Stack Project

    - Build a Django project backend by a relational database to create a website that allows users to store and manipulate data about a particular domain. 

2. Multiple Apps

    - The project must be a brand new Django project, composed of multiple apps (an app for each potentially reusable component in the project).

3. Data Modelling

    - Put some effort into designing a relational database schema well-suited for the domain. Make sure to put some thought into the relationships between entities. Create at least two custom Django models beyond the examples shown on the course. 

4. User Authentication

    - The project should include an authentication mechanism, allowing a user to register and log in. There should be a good reason as to why the user would need to do so.

5. User Interaction

    - Include at least one form with validation that will allow users to create and edit models in the back-end (in addition to the authentication mechanism).

6. Use of Stripe

     - At least one of the Django apps should contain some e-commerce functionality using Stripe. This may be a shopping cart checkout or single payments. After paying successfully, the user would gain access to additional functionality/content on the site. Not that for this project, Stripe's test functionality should be used, rather than actual live payments.

7. Structure and Navigation

    - Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout. This could be achieved using Bootstrap, for example.

8. Use of JavaScript

    - The front-end should contain some JavaScript logic which enhances the user experience.

9. Documentation

    - Write a README.md file that explains what the project does and the value it provides to its users.

10. Version Control

    - Use Git and GitHub for version control.

11. Attribution

    - Maintain a clear separation between code written by oneself and code from external sources. Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code or for larger dependencies, in the README.

12. Deployment

    - Deploy the final version to a hosting platform such as Heroku.

13. Security

    - Make sure not to include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository. Make sure to turn off the Django DEBUG mode which could expose secrets.

# About

This website is for "Jim's School of Motoring" a fictional driving school which uses it's online platform to manage learner driver's lesson bookings and collect payments.

The site is centered on user profile functionality. In this way, it provides an online portal allowing learners to register for an account and book their lessons online.
This means no more phone calls, no more waiting lists and no having to talk to a human being.

The booking process displays the dates and times that are available and will save their booking preference if their payment details are validated by Stripe.
